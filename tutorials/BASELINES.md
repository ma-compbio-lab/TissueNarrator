# Baselines

The tutorials use only the built-in Nearest-Neighbor and Class-Mean baselines. The
external baselines from the paper are listed here for reference.

## Spatial gene-expression prediction

Mouse→human symbol mapping, then an MLP head is trained after the pooling layer to
predict gene expression.
